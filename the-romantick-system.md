loving is one of the easiest things you’ll ever do. it’s also one of the hardest. when we met, both of us were struggling with love. we were trying to pour it out into the world without having nearly enough for ourselves or knowing how to ask for it from the people in our lives. when we began talking about magick and the idea of working together, we knew we wanted our practice to be powerful and honest, and that transparency was a must. it seemed clear, then, that love should be at the center of our work.

but we quickly learned that our simple choice of love was anything but, for love is just as esoteric and mysterious as any other element of magick. as we grew closer, our friends became concerned. what did our relationship mean for our respective marriages? were we divorcing our partners to be together? but it wasn’t that at all. their concern made us realize how many facets of love society often fails to value: love between friends, love for the divine, the artist’s love for his muse, and so many others. It is this deeply multifaceted nature of love that we hoped to share through romantick.

so, we set forth to create an artistic system that encourages the audience to look at the world—and the people in it—through a lens of love and intention. to blur the lines between artist and muse, friend and lover, ritual and romance, reality and fantasy. to create a soundtrack that inspires and adds rhythm to the great adventure we call life. to use love to shed our fear bodies, be vulnerable, and connect to one another on a deeper level. to obtain the unobtainable. to achieve the impossible. (we’re both a little dramatic.)

the rituals we perform are intended to both inspire outwardly and build inwardly, guiding our medium to a level far greater than we could achieve alone. we are writing a romantic story for the audience to get lost in. we encourage you to take what we’ve created and further develop it based on our intentions. and, above all, make it romantick.

below you will find some of the practices and experiences (in bold) we had as we developed romantick. we hope you will be inspired by this guide to create rituals and practices of your own.
