I like to say a wizard found me wandering in the woods. He held up his lantern. He showed me a new path. It was the path home. He took my hand and led the way.

It was May 2019 and I was busy making mistakes in my life. The only thing that felt right was my physical fitness, an aspect that led Jeffrey to contact me about using me as a model in his art. I was strong, he said, and would make a great subject for a painting.

I felt anything but strong, but I told him I’d consider it.

First, however, I had questions. Who was he? Where did his inspiration come from? What he did he believe? What was his story? As a journalist, I had to have these answers before we could move forward.

What began as a simple Instagram conversation quickly grew into a rapid-fire bearing of hearts and minds. We were nothing alike on paper, yet we immediately felt a deep connection to one another that surpassed understanding.

The first several months of our friendship unfolded quickly. We marked the 29th of each month as our anniversary, the day of our first conversation. In that time Jeffrey introduced me to Druidry and [OBOD](http://www.druidry.org), a beautiful group that we are both members of today. We met up on road trips to create art and practice magick, he traveled cross-country to help my family hold a garage sale, and I flew up to visit him on numerous occasions.

Over those meetings and many hours on the phone, we came up with the idea for romantick. Then we changed it, about a thousand times. But no matter how the details changed, the heart of it remained the same: romantick is a way to approach all aspects of life. Whether you are using it with a partner or friend or on your own. Whatever your beliefs or spiritual practices. Whatever your job or lifestyle. Romantick is a lens of mindfulness, intention, creativity, and love. What we have done in building it may resonate deeply with you, but it also may not. Our hope is that you will take it and make it your own.

As I write this, Jeffrey and I are days away from celebrating 11 months of knowing one another. We are best friends, magical partners. Working together to build a business, to help others. Crafting a magical practice that we can all use to better our lives. In less than a year we have been through some intense trials. We have very nearly fallen apart. But neither of us has given up because we know our calling is bigger than any conflict.

I remember the day Jeffrey told me he was a wizard. He had crafted this powerful character to rise above many years of pain and darkness, to explore the adventure of life. It was one that made him giggle too, a key component of his beliefs and outlook. He has often told me, “If you can’t laugh at your spirituality, you’re doing it wrong.” We have applied the same principle to romantick. There will be elements that seem childish or silly, and that’s just what they’re meant to be. We believe that life is a game. You win when you can laugh at yourself. When you can find joy in even the grimmest circumstances. When you can forge a friendship out of thin air. When you can hold on strongly to love even in your weakest moments. Carve out your own path on this romantick journey. We are but your humble guides.

### **disclaimer**

The posts that follow are meant to be a framework. The idea behind romantick is not that it is a magical system, meant to be followed to the letter, but that it is a lens through which we should view the entirety of our lives. Mindfulness, awareness, creativity, and love are at its core. We encourage you to approach every relationship, every creative endeavor, every part of your life with all these things in mind. It is through these beautiful principles that we believe you will find the deepest of connections, fulfillment, joy, and peace. May you be blessed. /|\
